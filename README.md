# Basic-Bash-Projects
The code which you find in this repo are some of the basic bash projects done by me:)
if any of the projects are not working in your system please install dos2unix package,<br />
and run the following command in your shell: dos2unix <filename>.sh<br />
and then run:  ./<filename>.sh
